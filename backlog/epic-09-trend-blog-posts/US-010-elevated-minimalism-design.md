# US-010: Elevated Minimalism: The 2026 Wedding Design Playbook

**Epic:** Epic 09 - Trend Blog Posts
**Priority:** P2
**Story Points:** 3
**Status:** Draft

## Description

Create a sophisticated, design-focused blog post unpacking the "elevated minimalism" aesthetic—the defining wedding design trend of 2026. This post teaches couples and planners how to execute warm, textural minimalism that feels intentional and luxurious, not cold or empty.

Based on trend research (Section 2: Visual Design Direction and Section 4: Texture Mixing), this post explores typography-led storytelling, texture over ornamentation, warm minimalism, and neo-minimalism. It's aspirational but actionable, with interactive design tools and before/after comparisons.

Key message: Less isn't boring. It's intentional. And when done right, it's breathtaking.

**Target Keyword:** "minimalist wedding design"
**Target Word Count:** 1500-1800 words
**Target Audience:** Design-savvy couples, couples planning modern or contemporary weddings, planners wanting to master the minimalist aesthetic, couples who love clean lines and natural materials

## Technical Notes

### Component Architecture
- Design principle cards:
  - Expandable/collapsible component with smooth CSS transitions
  - Image gallery within each expanded card (2-3 images per principle)
  - Lazy load images until card is expanded
- Texture palette builder:
  - React state for selected textures (max 3)
  - Conditional rendering of tablescape mockup based on selections
  - Canvas or pre-rendered mockup images (depending on complexity)
  - Download functionality: convert mockup to PNG using html2canvas or similar
- Before/after slider:
  - Use library like `react-compare-image` or custom implementation
  - Draggable handle with smooth animation
  - Touch-enabled for mobile swipe
- Mood board generator:
  - Grid selection component (toggle select on click)
  - Generate 2x2 or 3x2 grid from selected images
  - Canvas API or server-side rendering for downloadable mood board
  - Social sharing via Web Share API

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load all images below fold
