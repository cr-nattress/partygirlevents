## Technical Notes

- FAQ page uses the template built in Epic 02 US-006 — content population only, no template changes needed
- FAQ content model in CMS should support: question (string), answer (rich text for internal links and formatting), category (enum/select), sort order (number)
- FAQPage schema markup should be auto-generated from CMS data — each question/answer pair becomes a `Question` entity within the `FAQPage` schema
- Rich text answers should support: bold text, internal links, bullet lists (for answers that benefit from lists, like altitude tips)
- Consider implementing accordion UI for FAQ categories — expand/collapse for clean browsing experience (this should be handled by Epic 02 US-006 template)
- Internal links within answers should use descriptive anchor text, not "click here" — e.g., "learn about our full-service planning" linking to the services page
- FAQ content also serves as a training resource for any future chatbot or AI assistant (Epic 07)
- Some FAQ answers will naturally overlap with blog content (US-002) — the FAQ answer should be concise and link to the longer-form blog post for depth
- Track which FAQ questions users click most frequently to inform content strategy and identify new blog post opportunities
