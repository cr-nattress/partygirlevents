## Technical Notes

- Blog posts use the blog template built in Epic 06 US-003 — no new template development needed
- Schema markup (Article + BreadcrumbList) should be auto-injected by the template; content authors should not need to add markup manually
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) should revalidate blog listing and individual post pages when new content is published
- BOFU "Real Wedding" blog posts should link to the corresponding full case study (US-001) rather than duplicating all content — the blog post serves as a teaser/summary
- For AI-assisted drafting: use Stephanie's outline and notes as input, generate in her voice, she edits for authenticity
- Featured images should be served via next/image with AVIF/WebP and responsive srcset
- Consider implementing a "Related Posts" component at the bottom of each blog post, suggesting 2-3 other posts from different pillars
- RSS feed should auto-update when new blog posts are published
- Sitemap should auto-update to include new blog post URLs
